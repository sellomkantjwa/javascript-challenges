## Getting Started

### Creating your own repo

Click the "Use this template" green button above to create your own **private** instance of this repo - we don't want spoilers out in the wild. You should add me as a collaborator to it, so I can see your progress, which you can commit as you go.

### Install the dependencies
You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run your solutions.
Assuming that's installed on your system, install the dependencies for all the challenges in the root of this repo:

```
npm i
```

### Solve the challenges 😬

For each challenge, and within its corresponding folder:
- Understand the challenge via the `readme.md`
- Edit the corresponding `.js` file
- Test it by running `node <challenge>-test.js`
